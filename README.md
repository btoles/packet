# ü§∑‚Äç Assumptions
* The program is not user friendly, in the consumer sense, and is meant to be used by someone with technical skills.
* The operating system will be defined by `name` as it is the most human-readable identifier.

# üìÉ Instructions

1. `git clone` the repository.
2. `npm install` in the project directory after cloning.
3. Add `PACKET_API_TOKEN` to an `.env` file located at the root of the project.
```
PACKET_API_TOKEN=Token
```
4. `npm run launch` to launch the machine.
5. `npm run teardown` to teardown the device.

# ‚è∞ Time to Completion
It took roughly 2hr 30m before I ran into issues with service outage.

# NOTE
It seems there is an outage of sorts and I've been getting 5xx status codes for about half an hour now.  I'm going to submit what I have now and if needed I can go back later and polish or add more functionality!
